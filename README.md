# Surf and Ice Cream Shop

## Gather weather info for the mid-year to end year. 

### Determine if the business can be sustainable all year.


## Results

- We will start with the low for June is 64 degrees and December is 56 degrees. This is a is only an 8 degree difference in the low for the months. 

- With the highs for the months only being 2 degrees off this factor will help in the attraction of being able to run year round. 

- As we take note of the temperature average for the months, we see about a 4 degree difference. This still looks good for a year round business plain.

- The graph below show that there is really not much change from mid-year to end year

## Summary

- As far as the data that was gathered here this looks to have great potential for the business adventure at hand. We might want to dive deeper into the data ocean to pull up some more information that might help keep this afloat. We can find the data on the surf swells that are in the area and find trends to help customers look out for that opportunity to ride that wave that makes beach stories around the fires with friends. We also need to look at weather patterns as far as the precipitation for this not only affect surfing but can affect the ice cream part of the company due to slow volume on rainy days. The last thing that would be nice is the water temperature for the area. This can affect the gear needed to go surfing from full wetsuits to just normal swimming attire. There is a good start here but more needs to be looked at to compete the whole picture so that this business can ride the wave to success!
